# Australia Recruits Doctors that Ireland Struggles to Retain

##  A look into emigration in the Irish context 

My aim with this project was to investigate this topic and understand how many medical professionals choose to leave Ireland to go to Australia, and where they go. 

I have found that almost half of Irish medical  graduates leave to go and work in Australia, namely in search of better working conditions, and better pay. The most popular destination is Western Australia. Out of all doctors who emigrate to Australia, the vast majority are between the ages of 20 and 29. 

## Data Collection 

- The visa data for this project was obtained from the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs [website](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/). This Department publishes pivot tables of all 457 skilled visas which are granted, with the information regarding the grantees' citizenship, age, occupation and their destination in Australia. 

- The number of medical graduates in Ireland was obtained from [this report](https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/news-and-publications/reports/medical-workforce-intelligence-summary-report-2021.pdf) published by the Irish Medical Council in 2021. 

- The number of medical graduates from OECD countries was obtained from the OECD [website](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/medical-graduates.htm). 

## Data Analysis 

- Basic cleaning and merging of these datasets was done in the notebook plotting.ipynb, using Pandas. 

- Charts were made in R and [RAWgraphs.io](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) and edited in Adobe Illustrator. 

## New Skills 

Lots of new skills! (that need to be polished)

- R / GGplot
- RAWgraphs
- Adobe Illustrator
- ai2html

## Remaining items on the to do list 

- Make my charts responsive. I will do this!! I am just new to Illustrator and it took me a long time to make the charts in the first place and I didn't have the time to make different versions for each chart. 

- I have an interview about this with an Irish doctor in Australia, and I hope to rewrite the text based on that conversation. I have also reached out to others who I hope to be able to talk to.  

- Centering some text (I think I need to make a better index html template to do this more easily for the next projects)

- Make my charts bigger on the page (this seems simple yet I have not managed to do it without messing up the display/layout of my charts)
