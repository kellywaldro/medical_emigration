# Australia Recruits Doctors that Ireland Struggles to Retain

##  A look into emigration in the Irish context 

My aim with this project was to investigate this topic and understand how many medical professionals choose to leave Ireland to go to Australia, and where they go. 

I have found that almost half of Irish medical  graduates leave to go and work in Australia, namely in search of better working conditions, and better pay. The most popular destination is Western Australia. Out of all doctors who emigrate to Australia, the vast majority are between the ages of 20 and 29. 

## Data Collection 

- The visa data for this project was obtained from the Australian Government Department of Home Affairs [website](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/). This Department publishes pivot tables of all 457 skilled visas which are granted, with the information regarding the grantees' citizenship, age, occupation and their destination in Australia. 

- The number of medical graduates in Ireland was obtained from [this report](https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/news-and-publications/reports/medical-workforce-intelligence-summary-report-2021.pdf) published by the Irish Medical Council in 2021. 

- The number of medical graduates from OECD countries was obtained from the OECD [website](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/medical-graduates.htm). 

## Data Analysis 

- Basic cleaning and merging of these datasets was done in the notebook plotting.ipynb, using Pandas. 

- Charts were made in R and [RAWgraphs.io](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) and edited in Adobe Illustrator.
